# schedubuddy-server

This program is the server back-end of [schedubuddy](https://schedubuddy.com/), a schedule generator for the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html).
This codebase handles the construction of a local database which it then uses itself.
Raw data is processed to generate several schedules for a queried list of courses, and then ranked and filtered according to user preferences.
This is useful for when a student knows the courses they wish to take, and wants to create an optimal schedule.
